#Redirecting
##(Step 5) from Doris
###To redirect from a short URL:
type into browser in the format of:
>http://localhost:8080/url-shortener/public/"shortURL here" 

for example:
>http://localhost:8080/url-shortener/public/aaa123

###Notes:
I have only prebuilt shortURLs, which are in a hashmap of type <String, String>
aaa123 = http://www.google.com
bbb123 = http://www.fullerton.edu
ccc123 = http://www.yahoo.com
